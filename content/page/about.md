I got my start in the industry over 10 years ago as a lead generation focused B2B marketer, whilst working towards becoming a Chartered Marketer. During this time I became a specialist in CRM, email marketing, forms and landing pages. It wasn't until 2014 that I got my first taste of a single, fully integrated Marketing Automation system as a Pardot end user.

I enjoyed working with Pardot so much that I decided to join a Pardot Consulting Partner to gain experience in helping as many businesses in as many industries as possible.

In the past few years, I've travelled far and wide to work with over 50 clients and trained delegates from over 30 countries in best practice in Pardot and Marketing Automation.

Pardot is a significant investment for your organisation, but for in-house marketers, it's incredibly difficult to make the most out of the platform when it's only a small part of your day-to-day role.

Here are some of the challenges I help clients with on a day-to-day basis:

* Pardot Training
* Form and Landing Page Design & Setup
* Email Design and Campaign Execution
* Outsourced Pardot Administration
* Email Preference Centers & GDPR Compliance
* Salesforce integration and troubleshooting
