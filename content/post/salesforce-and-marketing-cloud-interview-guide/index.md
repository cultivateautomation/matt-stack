Right now, the Salesforce jobs market is challenging for candidates, sometimes with hundreds of applicants for each job posted. With so many applicants vying for the same roles, how can you stand out and land your dream Salesforce job? I'm a Salesforce Engineering Manager and I presented at the Manchester Salesforce User Group recently to share some tips with candidates applying for Salesforce and Marketing Cloud roles. I've made a blog post of the content of the presentation so that folks who couldn't attend can still benefit from the content:

**Step 1: Searching for Opportunities**

-   **LinkedIn is Your Friend:** If you're ready to hit the ground running, turn on your LinkedIn "Open to Work" banner. Ignore the endless LinkedIn clickbait debates around whether this is a good idea to do or not. This signals to recruiters that you're actively looking and available. Try to also add relevant keywords to your profile and a high level summary that highlights your Salesforce skills and experience.
-   **Build Relationships with Recruiters:** Yes, some recruiters have a bad rep in the industry. But the way I see it, recruiters only get paid if they place you. Connect with them, keep your profile updated, and be responsive to their messages. Try to find two or three recruiters who you can build a relationship with - they'll keep you top of their mind when a relevant role comes across their desk.
-   **Network, Network, Network:** Sometimes, the best opportunities aren't advertised. Let your network know you're looking for a Salesforce role; you never know who might have a lead. In my current role, some of our strongest performers were referred by word of mouth - sometimes we didn't have a job role open at the time, but created one for the right person. Try to attend industry events, connect with Salesforce professionals on social media, and reach out to former colleagues or classmates.

**Step 2: Applying for Roles**

-   **Authenticity is Key:** Skip the ChatGPT shortcuts for your CV and cover letter - hiring managers can smell AI a mile away, and it doesn't reflect well on you. Think about how you can signal your genuine skills and experience. Customise your application to each role, highlighting your specific skills and accomplishments that are the most relevant.
-   **Highlight Your Development:** Hiring managers want to see that you're invested in your Salesforce journey. Keep your Trailblazer.me profile fresh and highlight your certifications and Trailhead badges. I always check Trailblazer.me when hiring, and I'm sure other hiring mangers do too. Think about how you can tweak your CV to show that you're committed to continuous learning and development.
-   **Keep it Simple:** A clean and straightforward CV layout is best. Stick to two pages and make sure it's easy to read -- for both humans and applicant tracking systems. Use clear headings and bullet points to organise your information, and proofread carefully for any errors or typos.

**Step 3: Acing the Interviews**

-   **Understand the Interview Process:** Some Salesforce end users have multiple interview stages (architectural, technical, and behavioral). If you're prepared correctly, this ca give you a chance to shine and showcase different aspects of your skillset. Research the company and the role thoroughly, and be prepared to answer questions about your experience, skills, and motivations.
-   **Technical Interviews:** Remember, it's not just about finding the solution. Explain your thought process and your choices, and talk through considerations like scalability and testing. Practice solving real-world Salesforce problems (e.g. CTA board exam questions if you're high level) and be ready to discuss your approach in detail.
-   **Behavioral Interviews:** Prepare examples that demonstrate your ability to collaborate, problem-solve, and deliver results. Hiring managers look for candidates who can talk through the business context of what they've delivered, so be prepared to quantify your accomplishments with metrics and impact. Show that you're not only a skilled Salesforce professional but also a team player who can make a positive contribution to the company culture. Whilst I said earlier that ChatGPT should be avoided for producing documents seen by hiring managers, one great way to use it is to ask it to run a mock interview for you - this is a great way to practice. 

**Step 4: Decision and Offer**

-   **Follow Up:** A thank you email after your interview is very unlikely to make a difference in the hiring decision, treat this as purely optional
-   **Be Transparent:** If you're interviewing with multiple companies, it's okay to mention it. This shows that you're in demand and might speed up the decision from the hiring manager.
-   **Negotiate with Confidence:** When you receive an offer, be prepared to negotiate your salary and benefits. Know your worth and advocate for yourself. Research salary trends for similar roles in your area and be ready to discuss your expectations.
